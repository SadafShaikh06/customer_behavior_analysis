# customer_behavior_analysis
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior using 3,900 transaction records. Python was used for data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, followed by SQL analysis in MySQL to study spending patterns, discounts, subscriptions, and customer segments. Insights were visualized using an interactive Power BI dashboard to support business decisions.

**Overview**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, exploration, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting. The goal is to extract meaningful business insights from raw data using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and present the findings through a structured report and presentation.

**Dataset**
1. Source: Provided dataset (CSV format)
2. Records: ~3,900 rows
3. Features include customer demographics, purchase details, discounts, subscriptions, and ratings
4. Minor missing values handled during data cleaning

**Tools & Technologies**
a. Python: Data loading, EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering
b. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
c. MySQL: SQL queries for business analysis
d. Power BI: Interactive dashboard creation
e. Gamma: Presentation (PPT) creation
f. Documentation: Project report (PDF)

**Project Steps**
1. Loaded the dataset in Python using Pandas
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand distributions and patterns
3. Cleaned data by handling missing values and standardizing columns
4. Performed feature engineering for better analysis
5. Loaded cleaned data into MySQL
6. Ran SQL queries to answer key business questions
7. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard
8. Created a detailed report and presentation summarizing insights

**Dashboard**
The Power BI dashboard provides insights into:
a. Customer demographics and segments
b. Spending patterns and discounts
c. Subscription vs non-subscription behavior
d. Product and category performance

**Results & Insights**
a. Identified high-value customer segments
b. Analyzed the impact of discounts on spending
c. Compared subscriber and non-subscriber behavior
d. Highlighted top-performing products and categories

**How to Run**
1. Clone the repository
2. Install required Python libraries
3. Run the Python scripts for EDA and data cleaning
4. Import the cleaned dataset into MySQL
5. Execute SQL queries
6. Open the Power BI file to explore the dashboard
